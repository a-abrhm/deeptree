# DEEPTREE
### -- A decision Tree Classifier

## Overview

This project is a custom implementation of a decision tree classifier inspired from [scikit-learn-decision-tree-classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html). The classifier does not rely on popular packages such as numpy and pandas.

Gini index is used by the classifier to construct the decision tree. Using the gini index for partitioning has allowed the classifier to handle both continuous and categorical features. This allows the classifier to be used in a wider range of applications and datasets.

In addition, the classifier also includes a basic tree printing functionality, which can be used to visualize the tree structure and gain a better understanding of how the classifier is making its decisions.

## Getting Started

To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine and follow the instructions in the README.md file. The repository includes example code and datasets to help you get started.

## Features

* Implementated from scratch
* Handles both continuous and categorical features
* Uses Gini index to measure impurity of partion
* Includes basic tree printing functionality for tree visualization

# Requirements

Python 3.x
[Optional] Any text editor or IDE of your choice for editing the code.
